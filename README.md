Irizar is a Cuis web framework build on top of WebClient which allows to define routes and controllers in a handy way.

This is a work in progress, so feel free to fork and open a PR!

## Getting started

1. You would need a [Cuis smalltalk image](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev).
2. Once it is running, you just drag and drop the `Irizar.pck.st` file into Cuis.
3. Open a Workspace and just run `IrizarWebServer instance listenOn: 8080`
4. Register a route:
```Smalltalk
IrizarWebServer instance 
	handle: '/smalltalks' 
	verb: #GET 
	with: [ :request | request send200Response: '{ "hello": "Smalltalks" }' contentType: 'application/json' ]
```
